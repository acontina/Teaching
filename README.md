## 2016-2018: Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow for the National Science Foundation – National Research Traineeship (NRT) Earth Observation Science for Society and Sustainability (EOS3) 
The EOS3 was an interdisciplinary graduate program consisting of a four-course sequence offered at the University of Oklahoma. 
The certificate emphasized integration of natural and social sciences approaches to data exploration and visualization while building student competency in interdisciplinary team leadership and communication. 

## 2014: Animal Movements & Disease Risk
I developed and taught a brand new senior-level course at the University of Oklahoma. This course integrated animal migration ecology and zoonotic risk. The curriculum explored ecological aspects of animal migration such as different migration strategies among species, risk and benefits of migration, and how researchers track and study animal movements.
